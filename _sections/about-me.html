<p> I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India.
  I did my Doctorate in the Astronomy & Astrophysics department of the Physical Research Laboratory under 
  the guidance of Prof. Shashikiran Ganesh last year. My research focuses on the understanding of the morphology of the Milky Way Galaxy.
  In my PhD, I traced the face-on and the edge-on structure of our Galaxy using the distribution of intermediate-old stars; Red clump stars. 
  Apart from this, I am also studying the 3D dust distribution in the Galaxy using interstellar polarization. 
  I have observed multiple open clusters in different directions utilizing Indian observational facilities to constrain the small-scale and large-scale features in the Galactic disk.
  I have made pipelines for the automated data reduction for EMCCD-based POLarimeter (EMPOL), mounted on 1.2~m Mount Abu telescope, PRL 
  , and for ARIES IMaging POLarimeter (AIMPOL) at the backend of  1.04~m Sampurananad telescope of ARIES, Nainital, India. </p>
